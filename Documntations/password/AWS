-------------AWS---------------------- 
1. Region ---- it is a location with mutiple availablility zones.
2. AWS availablility ZOnes --- these are the isolated locations within a region.
3. LOCAL zone : not in every region and local zone , are seperate from availablility zone near to population, industries, IT.
4. wavelength zone : reduce latency for the mobile devices and end-user by providing the availablility zone in between the 5g network providers.
____________
5. VPC per Region =  default=5 / need to quote after that
6. Subnets per VPC = 200 default / quote request after that
Cidr per VPC = 5 , max 50 , after 5 , need to quote
___________________
AWS VPC, it enable  us to create a private network in our own isolated Area.
AWS VPC cidr are the range of ips allocated in a VPC.
       /24 = 256 IPs
       /16 = 65536 IPs
easiest way to find the cidr ==== total are 32 
if given cidr is /24 then
                           32-cidr
                         (2)
Subnet is a segmented piece of a larger network
support we have a network 10.10.0.0/24
then what will be the subnets : 10.10.1.0/24, 10.10.1.0/24 so on
___________________
7. Security Group
 it is a virtual firewall that help us to control traffic comming toward the instance and going from the instance
8. NACL is a firewalld that protect the subnet and sg help to protect the instance.
___________________
9. Internet Gateway and Nat Gateway
internet gateway allow a instance to access the internet with public ip and nat gateway allow instance to access the internet without public Ips.

internet Gateway                     instance <--------two way connection--------> external service
10. NAT Gateway                          instance --------one way connection--------> external service
__________________
11. Endpoint ---- VPC endpoint help to create a connection with any service without requiring that you use a what gateway , it deosnt matter
__________________
12. DHCP options : it help to resolve the domains name and ip addresses or dns.
or
                it is a network configuration to allow instance to communicate in a private subnet.
                also we resolve dns or domains names by using it.
__________________
13. DNS and hostname 
DNS is a standard to resolve the naem over the internet corresponding to their ips.
hostname is a name uniquely assigned to a instance and it composed of domain name and hostname.
__________________
14. Stateless and state full
stateless, deos not store the data 
statefull storethe data. example dbs require storage
___________________
does security group are stateless or statefull
Security groups are statefull because they track or storethe information of incoming and outgoing traffic from and to an instance.
__________________
aws git creds --- we use git init and git --config in aws cnsole to use aws credentials

15. ECS 
16. ECR
17. S3
18. Lambda

19. ECR vs other registries

20. cloud front ---- to speed up the statis and dynamic web pages or content

21. cloud formation ---- IAAC like terraform
22. Amplify......... frontend web and mobile developers easily build, ship, and host full-stack applications on AWS
23. Transit gateway........  you can use to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks
24. fadrated access..... user that can access secure AWS account resources with external identities
25. instant profile IAM ...  container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an Amazon EC2 instance when the instance starts
26. load balancer types.
i) application LB .. HTTP,HPPTS
ii) Network LB .. (TCP/SSL)
27. kms .. key management service used to protect data and gives authenticsation to used used their networks in their organizations.
28. firestore .. nosql document oriented db, sql contains on rows and colums but it's documents based.
29. ECS prerequistes .... https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/tutorial-ecs-prereqs.html
30. Artifacts .... When an action runs, or an event occurs, it acts upon a file or a set of files. These files are called artifacts,
These artifacts are used in later steps in the pipeline.
31. Amazon API Gateway
Create, maintain, and secure APIs at any scale

----------------
ECR ... elastic container registory is used to store docker images.
ECS ... elastic container services is used to the ECS takes these files and actively uses them in the deployment of applications.
